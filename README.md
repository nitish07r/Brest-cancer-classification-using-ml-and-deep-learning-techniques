# Brest-cancer-classification-using-ml-and-deep-learning-techniques
The primary objective of this project is to develop  a robust and accurate system for the early  detection of breast cancer. By leveraging  machine learning and deep learning algorithms,  we aim to classify breast tumors as malignant or  benign based on various features extracted from  medical images.
