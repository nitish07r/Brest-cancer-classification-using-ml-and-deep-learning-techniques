# Brest-cancer-classification-using-ml-and-deep-learning-techniques
The primary objective of this project is to develop  a robust and accurate system for the early  detection of breast cancer. By leveraging  machine learning and deep learning algorithms,  we aim to classify breast tumors as malignant or  benign based on various features extracted from  medical images.

Machine Learning Classifiers Used:
Logistic Regression
K Neighbors Classifier (KNN)
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
SGD Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Voting Classifier
Ada Boost Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB)
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

Results:
The classification models were trained and 
evaluated on a dataset of breast cancer samples. 
The performance metrics, including accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1-score, were computed for 
each classifier. Notably, the Gradient Boosting 
Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 
97.66%, making it the most effective model for 
our breast cancer classification task.

Deep Learning Approach:
In addition to traditional machine learning 
methods, we explored the effectiveness of deep 
learning using a neural network. The neural 
network achieved an accuracy of 95.6% in 
classifying breast cancer samples.

Conclusion:
The promising results obtained from both 
machine learning and deep learning approaches 
demonstrate the potential of these techniques in 
accurately identifying breast cancer. The high 
accuracy achieved by the Gradient Boosting 
Classifier suggests its effectiveness in clinical 
applications for early cancer diagnosis.t
